# Agents of the System

Turn your computer into an Agent! Smith will allow you to host private game servers with minimal effort directly on the machine you, likely, use most: Your gaming PC!  Later, find a crew, plug your programs into The Architect and share control over them.  Or, you can go it alone and use an Operator to directly interact with your agents.
